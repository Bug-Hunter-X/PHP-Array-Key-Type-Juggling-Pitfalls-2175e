The solution involves using strict comparison (`===`) when working with array keys. 

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["1"] = "one";
$myArray[1] = "One";

// Using strict comparison for key checks
 if(!array_key_exists("1", $myArray, true)){ // true for strict comparison
    $myArray["1"] = "one";
 }
 if(!array_key_exists(1, $myArray, true)){ // true for strict comparison
    $myArray[1] = "One";
 }


echo count($myArray); //Outputs 2

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
```

Alternatively, you can use `array_unique()` with the `SORT_REGULAR` flag to remove duplicate keys with loose comparisons before proceeding with your operations, however, strict comparison is generally preferred.

By using strict type checking, the code reliably distinguishes between string and integer keys, solving the type juggling issue and maintaining the integrity of the array.
