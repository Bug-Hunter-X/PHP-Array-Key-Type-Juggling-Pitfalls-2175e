In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not strictly numeric.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["1"] = "one";
$myArray[1] = "One";

echo count($myArray);
```

One might expect the `count()` function to return 2, as there are two distinct elements. However, PHP's type juggling can lead to unexpected behavior.  Since "1" can be loosely compared to the integer 1, PHP treats them as the same key, effectively overwriting the previous value. Therefore, `count($myArray)` will return 1.

Another example is using array_keys() with a non-strict comparison. This function might return fewer keys than expected when duplicates or type-juggled keys are present.

This is especially problematic if your keys are generated dynamically from user input or external data sources where the type consistency might not be guaranteed.
