# PHP Array Key Type Juggling Pitfalls

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in PHP related to array key type juggling.  Loose comparison of array keys can lead to unexpected behavior, potentially resulting in data loss or incorrect array sizes.

The `bug.php` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.php` provides a solution using strict key comparisons to avoid the problem.

## Problem

PHP's loose type comparison can cause keys that should be distinct to be treated as the same key, leading to overwriting of values.

## Solution

The solution involves using strict comparison (`===`) or type casting to ensure that keys are treated distinctly, preventing data loss and ensuring accurate array operations.
